The game begins after all the ships have taken their positions. Click on the empty cells on the opponent's field and try to guess all his ships.
The classic Battleship Game should have:
- 4 ships with one cell;
- 3 ships with 2 cells;
- 2 ships with 3 cells;

The Battleship game is played until the player or computer has won completely. This means that you must find all the opponent ships in order to win.
